								<h4>Sandayu Momochi</h4>
								<p>Sandayu Momochi was expertly skilled in ninjitsu and the use of various weapons. It is believed that he was the leader of one of the most powerful ninja clans during the Edo Period in Japan. His fame was so widespread, there was a monument built in his honor, which is pictured above. There were 3 powerful Ninja Clans which resided in the Iga Province. Sandayu Momochi was believed to be the head of the Southern Clan and ran 3 ninja schools in the area.</p>

								<h4>Iga-Ueno Castle</h4>
								<p>One of the top historical sites in Japan is the Iga-Ueno Castle. Located in Iga, where many Ninjas lived and trained during the Edo Period, this castle was once owned by the powerful landlord and governing official (known as a Daimyo) Todo Takatora. Originally built as a “defense weapon” for the area, it was later converted to a governing office after 1602. These pictures posted here were all taken by Dr. Hirohisa Oda, author of the book “Real Ninja”.</p>
